# Workflow: Vibe Check
# Trigger: /vibe [feature_idea]

**Goal:** Go from a loose idea to a visual mockup.

**Steps:**
1.  Analyze the user's `[feature_idea]`.
2.  Brainstorm 3 distinct visual styles for this feature.
3.  Present them as a bulleted list with "Pros/Cons" for each.
4.  **STOP** and wait for user selection.
5.  Once selected, generate a high-fidelity image of that UI using the Image Generation tool.
6.  Ask: "Does this match the vibe? If yes, shall I build the React components?"
